## Manufacturing Information ##

We have long-standing cooperation with a number of trusted manufacturing partners who have proven to have robust manufacturing capacity in all kinds of scenarios. They also have separate supply sourcing teams, and we will do our best to make sure customer receive their hotspots as soon as possible. We will continue using these manufacturers to produce indoor LoRa light hotspots and 5G CBRS hotspots.

## Proof of Identity

Separately submitted to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

JDI is a financially stable enterprise and plans to invest US$6M to support this project. We have 300K lora modules and parts for 100K 5G hotspots in stock ready for manufacturing. Based on the current estimate, we expect to delivery at least 30Ku per month in the first 6 months and allow production flexibility as customer demand requires.

## Risks & Challenges

Since our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service. One other concern is the parts supply, we plan to expand on supply sources to guarantee stability.
